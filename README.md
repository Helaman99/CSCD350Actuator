# CSCD350Actuator
A program that is used to simulate the movement of a simple actuator.

This was an assignment in my CS350 class where we had to create a basic program that
would simulate an actuator. We had to keep track of specified bounds, acceleration,
velocity, direction, and position and simulate the actuator moving between multiple
positions.

This program was built as a componant to another, and therefor doesn't really have any 
functionality on it's own. If you want to run this program, there are tests that can 
demonstrate its capabilities.

### To Run

Within the `CSCD350Actuator/task4/src` folder, run the MotionTest file to run tests on the program.
